Early detection of tumors is critical for improving patient outcomes and extending life expectancy. **Advanced brain tumor detection** is essential in the medical field, particularly for diagnostic and treatment applications. **Automated brain tumor detection** in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a significant role in enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

This study presents an **optimized brain tumor detection method** utilizing the **template-based K-means (TK) algorithm** combined with **super pixels and principal component analysis (PCA)** to efficiently identify brain tumors with reduced execution time. Initially, **key features are extracted** using both **super pixels and PCA**, improving detection precision. Next, **image enhancement techniques** are applied using a filter to enhance accuracy. Finally, **image segmentation** is carried out using the **TK-means clustering algorithm**, effectively identifying brain tumors.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by achieving **higher accuracy and lower execution time** in MRI-based brain tumor detection.
